the appearance 01 being earlier and more rudimentary than those 01 the
other: he 1101 unfrequently 100 sees that something is wanting and says
‘fragmentum ', where the latter supplies a whole verse with more 01 less
success. The scholar therefore completed what the master commenced3
and the emendationes Lucretius linhs their names together not less
honourably than does the verse we quoted from Ariosto. Upon the whole
this fresh information has greatly raised my estimato of both, especially
of Marullus. His industry is at least as conspicuous as his sagacity: he
has evidently carefully collated manuscripts and editions and gathered
materials from all accessible sources. Throughout the poem the many
verses omitted in the Muuich manuscript are supplied with unfailing
diligence. He evidently was acquainted with several 01 the existing
Florentine manuscripts; among others that 01 Niccoli Ibelieve, as well
as that of his enemy Politian, and Flor. 31 whose readings Lachmann
so strangely assigns to the notary Antonius Marii. Upon the whole he
must be placed as an emender of Lucretius immediately after Lambinus

Ἴ and Lachmann, if 1101 indeed in the same front rank, when we consider

the circumstances 01 his age and the imperfectiori of his materials; and
Pontanus perhaps may ranlr after him. Lambinus, as well as Avancius
and Naugerius editor 01 the second Aldine, must have had access 10
some copy of Pontanus’ corrections.

What I said 01 Marullus in my first edition with much more imper·
fect materiale 110111 which 10 draw conclusione, I find now confirmed in
essential points. There were in circulation different copies of Marullus’
emendations ; Gifanius had access to one of these: see notes 1 10 1 274
iv 1005, as well as 11 16 125 465 111 994 v 201 1151 v1 25: what I 111-
ferred 110111 his own poema is borne out by 11 719 01111749 andsome
other passages: the assertion 01 Crinitus quoted above that Marullus had
corrupted vr 651 052 is fully confirmed here: Marullus 101 the correct
multesima most unskilfully proposes malta extima3 and 101 tota reads
ait: the latter Candidus adopts. In other cases his more mature judg-
ment as seen in the Munich manuscript doubtless differed from his earlier
notions. A man who studied Lucretius so long and earnestly cannot
fail to have often changed his mind on further reflexion and with new
sources 01 information. Candidus does 1101 by any means follow Ponta-
nus 01 Marullus in his orthography: that is formed as I proved 111 my
first edition mainly on Avancius. In many cases they might have taught
him better ; 10 avoid for instance such ambellishments as his 00111010,
eiramis. He rightly however avoids such barbarisms as the hymbrae
and sylva of Marullus From 0110000 l'ttas arctus and the like, which
the latter carefully introduces, we may infer that he and Pontanus had

some share in bringing such corruptions into common use. The careful
collation which I have given 111 this edition 01 the emendations of
Pantanus and Marullus will prove their importance, ancl show how rash
