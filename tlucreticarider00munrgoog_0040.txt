304, and douhtless for the same reasons, because copied from thesaure
ms. from which B was taken. It usually goes by the name of the
Gottorpian fragment from the, place where it once was. I have three
collatione of it, one published by Henrichsen in 1846, another in the
handwriting of Nic. Heinsius, another in that 01 Ιο000 Vossius. For-
merly it had a very high reputation: in truth it much resembles, but is
more carelessly written than Β, and is seldom of much use, except once
or twice tc confirm A against B. Strangely enough there are in the
Vienna library fragments of a precisely similar ms. containing large por·
tions of the later books, viz. 11642t0111621 inclusive, omitting how-
ever in the proper place 11 ror-806 exactly as B does; then V1 743 10
1100 end; then follow, precisely asin Β, the four omitted portione given
above, proving this to 'be copied from the ms. from which B was taken.
Naturally enough these Vienna fragments were assumed to belong 10 one
and the same ms. 00 the Gottorpian 3 bnt Dr Ed Goebel, from whom I ’
have borrowed this description of them, seems to prove in the Rhenish
Mus. n 0. xri p. 4491011. that the two portione now bound together are
01 different sizes and belonged to different mss. However that may be,
the former part seems tc be the same ms. as the Gottorpian, and the
other if not the same, is precisely the same in infernal character; and in
either 0000 10 01 the same, that is of very little value. Probably there·
fore a more accurate collation would hardly repay the labour.

All other mss. known to exist were, as has been already said, copied
mediately or immediately from Poggio’s lost ms. which must have re·
sembled A almost as closely as the Gottorpian resembles B. The most
important are among the eight preserved at Florence in the Laurentian
library, numbered 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 of desk xxxv. 30 was written
by Nicolo N iccoli himself, who had Poggio‘s ms. so long in his possession:
this we 000 10Ιά in the learned Mehus’ preface to his life of Traversarius
p. 0. As he studied so many of Niccoli's manuscript letters, he must
have known his writing better than anybody else. There are many cor·
000110ηο in' a much later hand, but Niccoli himself seems on the whole to
have copied Poggic's ms. faithfully, and not to have made many changes.
His ms. therefore, as will be seen in notes 1, 10 01 great value in deciding
between A and B. Itis unfortunate that Lachmann could make no use
of it: I collated it with some care in the summer of 1851: the old

η Verona and Venice editions have a text closely resembling Niccoli's.

31 10 next in importance to 30, but 01 0 widely different character, hav-
ing 0 text much more corrected than Niccoli's or even Ver. and Ven. It
is clearly written and in excellent preservation, and much resembles in
general character the manuscript in our public librery which I had open
before me all the time Ι was composing notes 1, and which is as well
preserved and as distinctly written as the other. It excels the Cam-
bridge on the whole, though the latter has many good corrections notin
