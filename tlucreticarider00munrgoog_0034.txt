Heinsius Isaac Vossius, turned their attention to Lucretius; but their
labours were only desultory. of the 166. notes by the two last which
61616 my possession 1 will speak afterwards In 1662 Tanaquillus
Faber or Tanneguy ieiebvre published at Saumur 6 text 61 Lucretius
followed by amadatiorws and 6666166. Η6 666 6 616661 but vain 111611,
who seemed to think such work rather beneath him; he takes care how-
ever to inform his readers that he spent but little time or 661116 66 16,
6116 1166 only Lambinus and Giianius before him, though he owed nothing
6ο 6161161. The truth is that without Lambinus he could not have ad·
vanced 6 step: elever man that he is, he 6116166 6 good prool how much
Latin scholarship had deteriorated in France during the century between
him and Lambinus. 01 Ρ61666, Nardius, Fayus nothing need be said.

Had Bentley in 1689 or 1690 666666666 in his efforts 6ο obtain 161
6116 Bodleian Isaac Vossius’ famous library, he might have anticipated
what Lachmann did by a century and 6 11611. Α6 116 was at that very
time working hard 66 Lucretius, 11 116 1166 6666 got into his hands the
two 11166 now 66 Leyden, he would 66 6 glance have seen their import-
ance and would scarcely have failed to complete the edition which he
’ was then meditating. The great knowledge 61 Epicurus’ system which
116 displayed two years later in his Boyle lecturos and his zeal 161 6116
recently published Principia 61 Newton would have aided him in ex-
pounding the 6611666 61 6116 poet This however was not 66 be; but his
marginal notes published in the Glasgcw edition 61 Wakefield prove
what 116 could have done, 11116 had gone on with his design I cannot
doubt that Lucretius would have suited him better than Horace, and
offered a 161161 field 161 6116 exercise ο1 1116 61161661 divination.

In 1695 611616 came from the Oxiord 61666 6 Lucretius edited not by
Bentley, but by Thomas Oreech Fellow 61 All Souls, a man 61 66666
sense and good 66666, but to judge from his book 61 scmewhat arrogant
· and supercilious temper. The text 16 nearly always 6 reproduction 61
one 61 661161 61 6116 66161666 61 Lambinus: such criticism indeed he seems
in his 6161666 to look upon 66 unworthy 61 him. His notes are in most
cases mere abridgements 61 611666 61 Lambinus 61 copied from Faber,
and his illustratione are usually borrowed from the former. All this he
does 6611 16 were a matter 61 666166, 666 thinking it necessary either 66
avow or conceal his obligations. His interpretatio is his own: how 161
161661 assistance to 6 6666666 must depend upon what he seeks 161111
it. His Lucretius however owing 66 6116 clearness and brevity 61 6116
116666 1166 continued to be the popular one 11661 61166 time to the present.
· The worthy London bookseller J acob Tonson published in 1712 a

finely printed text with various readings at the end collected 11661 many
quarters with a great deal 61 trouble, 6616661 66166, most quite worth-
