the field oi conjecture, and lor nearly three centuries his remained the
standard text. Lachmann says he did much less than Marullus But
so faras there is truth in this, it is merely saying that the one lived
before the other: nine tenths of what Marullus effected‚ Lambinus could
have done currente calamo 3 but I doubt whether Marullus could have
accomplished one tenth oi what Lambinus succeeded in doing. Lach-
mann accuses him 06 strange levity and rashness But it must 66 66-
membered that in a short life he got through an amazing amount of
, work in conformity with the wants oi his age. He only gave two years
and a hali to his brilliant edition oi 666 whole of Cicero: and probably
did not spond many more months on his Lucretius than Lachmann spent
years Nor was it possible in that age even for a Lambinus to appre-
hend the true relation¹ ol the mss. oi Lueretius to one another. His
eopious explanatory and illustrative commentary¹ however calls for un-
qualified eulogy, and has remained down to the present day the great
originru storehouse, from which all have borrowed who have done
anything of value for the elucidation of their author. Scaliger says
‘Lambinus avoit fort peu de livres': ii 60 66 made good use of them,
as his reading is as vast as it is accurate, and its results are given in a
style oi unsurpassed clearness and beauty. His notes observe the mean
between too much and too little: he himself calls them briei, while his
thankless oountrymen‚ thinking however more perhaps oi his Horace

. than his Lucretius, have made 1666666 and lundiner classical terms to

express what is diffuse and tedicus. A second and much smaller edition
with only a few pagos oi notes, but with many variations from the first,
was published in 1565.

Scarcely could this first edition have issued from the press, when the
well-known scholar and jurisconsult Obertirs Gifanius of Buren began ,
with systematical and unprincipled cunning to pillage it and convert it
to his own purposes His Lucretius was printed by Plantin ol Antwerp
in 1566 as stated at the end, though of two copies before me the title
page of one has 06 it 1566, 666 06666 1565, which is the date of his own
666666660 Sambucus, and of the two privilegia at the end 3 for the
March 1564 of the first must be old style, as it is later than the Febru-
ary 1565 of the second. He brought nothing new to his task‚ except
the ms. notes oi Marullus in theold Venice ed. fully spoken ol above;
ior the emendations and readings oi Antonius Goldingamus homo
Anglus, which he speaks oi in his 6661666, 666 666 veteres libri and the
like which occur throughout his book are mere blinds to conceal his
theits from Lambinus. The way in which he contrives 66 once to bestow
empty praise on this scholar and yet to extenuate his merits and put him
as a commentator of Lucretius on the same level with other learned
men, Turnebus ior instance, is a marvel oi astuteness. In the preface to
his third ed. Lambinus states the truth with great terseness: ‘omnia
