and unfounded Lachmann's procedure is in assigning everything that is
new in the J untine to Marullus: even in the many instaures where he
and Ι are in agreement, it must be remembered that he speaks without
authority, while Ι possess the testimony of Marullus himself]

The J untine closes the first great epoch of improvement in the text
of Lucretius: the second Aldine edited by the well-known scholar An·
drew Naugerius and dated⁸ ‘mense ianuario unxv! is for the most part
a mere reprint of it without however one word of acknowledgment ac·
cording to the usage of the time. Yet the changes are not few, mostly
ior the better, not always: two instanccs are given above from the first
page, the one a gross corruption, the other a right rejection of an inter·
palation. For the next fifty years Ald. 2 appears to have been the model
edition. Gryphius of Lyons published several texts, three· of which ,
I have before me: they generally follow Naugerius, but not always,
often recurring 10 Arcucius. These of 1534 and 1540 ha've many mar-
ginal readings, most of them taken from Avancius or the notes oi Pius,

’ a few from sources not known 10 me: see notes 1 tol 977 efficiorque.
Yet even these two editions do not always agree with esch other.
Little advance however was made on the J untine before Dionysius
J Lambinus. He dates his address to Oharles IX 1 November 1563 and
afterwards speaks of his first edition as published in that year3 though
the titlepage of my copy has 1564. Lambinus was among the most
illustrious of the great Latin scholare who studied and taught at Paris
in the sixteenth century. His knowledge of Cicero and the older latin
writers aswell astho Augustan poeta has never been surpassed and
rarely equalled. Whoever doubts that the nicest critical and gramma-
tical questions can be expressed in Ciceronian Latin without effert or
affectation, let him study the commentaries of Lambinus. Scaliger says
of him ‘Latine et Romane loquebatur optimeque scribebat': his ease
and readiness are astonishing. He made use he tells us of five mss:
four of these appear 10 have been Italian mss. of the fifteenth century:
the fifth, of which he used a collation by Turnebus, and which he calls
the Bertinian, was the same as the Leyden quarto. In hle preface and
throughout the work he acknowledges his obligations to Turnebus and
Auratus. His Lucretius is perhaps the greatest of his works: there was
more 10 be done here, and therefore he has done more. He had more
over a peculiar admiration for this author, of whom in the preface to his
third edition he says ‘omnium poetarum Latinorum qui hodie exstant et
qui ad nostram aetatem pervenerunt elegantissimus et purissimus, idem-
que gravissimus atque ornatissimus Lucretius est’. If his boast· that he
has restored the text in 800 places goes beyond the truth, though Iam
not sure that it does, yet the superiority of his over all preceding texts
can scarcely be exaggerated3 for the quickness of his intellect united
with his exquisite knowledge of the language gave him great power in
