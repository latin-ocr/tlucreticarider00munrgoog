intervention for the special use of the copyist of this codexl Again I
would ask whether he looks upon the laborious and sagacious calcula·
tions, by which Lachmann demonstrated the number ol peges in the lost
archetype and the number of verses in each page, as a mere plaything
thus to be trifled with; and not rather as a key to unlock many secrets
of criticism and not to be understood even without some slight affort oi
mind. I beg to tell him that the number of lines in the archetype be-
tween 111 360 and 403 was not either 52 or 42, 000 44; 0000 is οο say
42 verses oi the poem ÷two headings: and that 111 360 did not com·
menae, nor 111 402 terminate a leaf, but that 111 360 was the fifth line
of page 108 of the archetype, and 111 402 was the fourth line from the
bottom of page 109. Further study too will perhaps make him regret -
that he has put 'the unfortunate paragraphs between 1 503 and 634 to a
fresh turture, and permit him tc see that in no part oi the poem is the
Ι argument or text in a sounder state—But even while revising the 200
ed. for the prees Ι found in a recent program by Th Bergk, with the
name of Ed. Heine on the title-page, a fresh attempt to magnify this
much vexed Victorian codex: in p. mv itis said that it ‘solus iusto ordine
exhibet libro 1v locum antiquitus archetypi schedae paginis inversis per·
turbatum: nam post v. 298 Atque ca continuo sequuntur v. 323 Servat.
...347 Ac resilire, tum v. 299 Splendida...322 Quae sito 0000, denique
v. 348 Quod contra. hoc igitur insigne est virtutis documentum, atque
possit aliquis inde colligere librum Poggianum ex archetypo descriptum
esse, antequam illae paginae inversae sunt' etc. Is it not strange that

so definite an assertion should be printed, when in truth this manuscript ,

has the verses in just the same invented order, in which they are given-
hythe Leyden and all other known msal Nay more the corrector
(Marullus without doubt) arranges the disordered lines, whether after
Politian or not, exactly 00 Candidus dces in the Juntine, who beyond
any question adopted his arrangement from this manuscript. And yet
the main purpose of the program spoken of is to prove Marullus not to
he the corrector oi this Victorian codex, and to prove it from. this very
passage l] It will be seen that by the materials which I have collected
and just described I have in many important cases got nearer than has

been done before to the readings oi Poggio's ms. which was a worthy
rival ol the leyden two.

But Lachmann's long experienee and disciplined acuteness have en-
abled him to go beyond existing mss and to tell us much ‚of the lost
archetype, as Ι call it after him, oi all existing mse. Notas 1 will shew
that many difficulties are cleared up by this knowledge. This archetype
then, though it is not certain that even A was immediately taken from
it, was written in thin capitale, like the medicean ol Virgil 3 the words
were not separated, but in the middle of verses points were put at the
end of clauses. Ancient mss. as arula keep with singular care to the
