have passed middle life when he perished in the river Cecina near Vol-
terra April the lOth 1500, he must have been a merc child when on
the capture oi his native city he was brought to Italy, probably to
Ancona. He received his training however in Florence, and he found
a Maecenas in Lorenzo de' Medici. Though he never printed anything
cn Lucretiae, his manuscript emendations appear tc have been well

> known during his life, and a copy of the poet to have been found on him
at his death: ‘ex miseranda illa in mediis Cecinae undis Latinarum
musarum iactura cladeque insigni unus est Lucretius receptus' says Can-
didus in his preface ; and his friend Petrus Crinitus in his de honesta
disciplina xv 4, published in 1504, but mostly written it would seem
before Maiullus' death, after well reinting an alteration of his which

, shall presently be referred to, adds ‘quae ab' eius quoque sectatoribus
recepta sunt pro verissimis’. This intense love of Lucretius he seems
only to have conceived in the latter years of his life. Candidus, whose

' preface full of feeling shews that ‘he greatly loved Marullus and deeply
deplored his untimely end, strives to make the most ofwhat he did: he
says ι11111111111111’11110 veneris peromnem aetatem studiosus fuit, ut
cet! But this must be an exaggeration: the first edition of his poema,
published without a date, bnt not later than 1490, containing only two
books of epigrama, shews so far as I can see no trace of any acquaintance
with Lucretius Catullus is chiefly imitated even in the elegiacs, and

¹ next 1ο him Tibullus and Horace. six peges from the beginning there
isa poor poem of eight lines ‘de poetis Latnis' [sie], in which he says
that Tibullus Maro Terence Horace Catullus, each in his kind, are
the only good Latin p'cets: Hos si quis inter 11111111 ponet 11111,
Onerat qaam honoret 111111. The Roman editions ci 1490 and 1493
Ihave not access to ; but in December 1497, two years and a few months
before his death, he published at Florence a much enlarged edition. A
third and fourth book of epigrams are added: in these too I find no
truce of Lucretius. Then follow four books cf hymni naturales. In
these, especially such as are written in heroice, the strain is ‘of a higher
mocd', and we meet with frequent imitatione of Lucretius even in the
lyrica, as opibusque lale pollens luis which recalls Ipsa sais 1111111111-
bus. But in these heroica it is to be noticed that the rhythm is Virgi-
lian, not in any respect Lucretian even where he closely follows the
latiens language, as in the hymn tc earth: Ante repentino caelipetam
11111111 haustu Vayiat 1111111111 in 111111 novas editus inform. 01111
proiectas humi nudas iacet, indique, exsors Anatilii, infirmusque pedam
infirmusque palati. Then imitating at once and contradicting Lucretius'

beginning to end of Lucretian phraseology. In this edition too he
