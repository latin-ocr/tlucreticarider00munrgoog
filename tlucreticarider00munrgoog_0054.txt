spelling therefore uncertain, such as the penult of superlativas and cer-
tain other adjectives, and words like lubet or libel, dissipator dissupat,
quadrupes or quadripes and many otherS, I have of course subnritted to
the guidance of our mss which only once for instance have v in the su-
perl. and once manufesta, and twice offer arbita, not arbeita. Augustus,
having learnt it probably in boyhood from the all-accomplished dictator,
for whose apprehension nothing was either too little or too great and l, <
who,Gellius tells ue, first introduced thei for v in superlativas, invaria (χχ
’ bly writes frequentissimus septimus vicensimas, as well as finitimus ma x
nibisis: comp. what Suetonius says of his use of simiis for snmus, pro
bably from a wish to be consistent. He would scarcely have thauked
Varius and Tucca for bringing him the Aeneid embellished with Wag-
ner's maxumus, sepiamus and the like, introduced so often in spite of his
mss. [Both forms arc found in the same sentence lex colon. Genetivae

Ι have likewise followed AB in the adoption of e or o in vertere or
¹ vortere and the like: e is naturally the more common, yet vorti versvm
divorsi vortitur convortere vortex are all found: also in reading reddunda
gignundis dicandum cernundi faciundum cynridis eet. or the more usual
’ agendum quaerendum cet. Do I then claim in all these doubtful cases
to reproduce the spelling of Lucretius or his first editor t Certainly not;
but still in most of them Lucretius and his contemporaries undoubtedly
’ allowed themselves much latitude; and I have not intentionally permit
ted anything to remain which might not have been found in one or other
nis. before the death of Virgil. By adhering tenaciously to the mss,
where not demonstrably wrong one gains a firm resting place from which
to make further advances‚ if better evidence offer itself. However that
may bc, Ι cannot bring myself to accept the arbitrary and eclectic system
of a Wagner, much less tha hideous barbarisms of a Wakefield, nor on
the other hand, after feasting on the generons cereals of a Lachmann and
saisselinus stomach the ‘conventional’ husks and acorns of the
ltalians of the leth century. At the same time it will be seen that my
spelling differs less from this system, than does that of Wagner in his
standard text of 1841, or even his subsequent modification of that text
for common use which Prof. Conington has adopted in his Virgil.
