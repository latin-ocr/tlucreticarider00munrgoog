PREFAOE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.

Tan present edition is divided into three volumes, the first con·
taining the text and critical notes, the second the commentary and
general index, the third the translation.

The text is practically the same as in the last edition: in one '
place only (1 442) a new reading is printed, and that was only omitted Ι

before through accident as was explained at the end of the index.
There are a few additions, not more than halfadoaem to the critical
notes 3 these have been inserted in square brackets. The translation

’ techas undergone no change.

In the commentary there are few alterations but considerable ἶ

additions amounting in all to more than twenty peges. These supple

mentary notes and illustratione have been taken from an interleaved ᾖ

copy of the last edition which was found among Mr Munro's books aiter

his death in the spring oi last year. . Also on p. 333 oi the commentary ¹

will be found some extracta from letters addressed by him to Professor
Palmer of Trinity Collega Dublin‚ discussing the reading oi v 1010;

Professor Palmer was kind enough to send me these letters. As

the extracta deal with the criticism rather than the explanation of the ⁸

passage, they should have been inserted in the first volume; but by
an accident they were delayed until after that volume was printed.
, Nothing has been inserted irom any other source whatever. Here
too all that is new has been inclosed in square brackets. In the new .
examples the references have been verilied. Το the index large
additions have been made by myself.

It remains to express my thanks to Dr Forbes‚ the relative and
executor of Mr Munna, ior the kindly feeling which led him to entrust

me with the preparation of this edition, and also ior the genereus
consideration he has shown throughout.

J. D. DUFF.
