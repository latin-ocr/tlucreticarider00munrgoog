inserts two new verses in the poem ‘de poetis Latinis' spoken oi above,
Natura magni versibus Lucretii Lepore musaeo illitis, the best in the
poem and recalling mamaea contingens cuncte lepore. Crinitus l.l. xxm

7 quotes this poem and mentions a conversation he had with Marullus
in which ‘factum est iudicium nupera nostro Marullo de poetis Latinis
egregie perfectum et prudenter ¹, and Ovid and other poets are blamed3
and then it is added ‘itaque legendi quidem sunt omnes inquit [Marul-
lus]; sed hi maxime probandi pro suo quisque genere Tibullus Horatius
Catullus etin comoedia Terentius. Vergilium vernet Lucretium edis·
candes moerebat& Let what has just been said be at once applied to a
striking interpolation. After 1 15 the J untine first inserted the v.
I llecebrieque tuis omnis natura animantum, which long kept its plaee in
Ι the common editions. Lachmann oi course attributes it to Marullus, as
do most editore. Lambinus says of it ‘neque eum Naugerius neque

authority is for that which he says ot Pontanus I do not know, but Nan·

· gerius editor oi the Aldine oi 1515 properly omits the line, though he

in general minutely copies the J untine. Now this line is written by the
hand of Angelo Politian in the margin oi a manuscript which belonged
tc him and forms xxxv 29 of the Laurentian library. Politian died in*
September 1494, when Marullus could hardly yet 'have done much ior
Lucretius ; and besides this as he had been long the deadly enemy of
Politian, it is not likely the latter would have inserted in his manuscript
one oi his verses. I infer therefore that it is Politian's own ; and as “
Candidus says in his preface that he collated all the ‘vetusta exemplaria’
in Florence, he could not have neglected this manuscript which was
theninthe famous conventual libraryoi San Marco. Iconclude therefore ·
that Candidus’ taking it from the margin of Politian's ms. is the right
explanation oi Ianottus' assertion that Marullus got it from an ancient
codex. It is quite possible indeed that Marullus copied it himself from
this ms. which passed to San Marco immediately aiter Politian’s decena,
and thus robbed him oi his verse aiter death, as he is said to have
robbed him oi his bride during life. Naugerius basin his first page
another variation from the J natine, but that a perverse one: in 1 7 hc
reads Adventaqoe tuo and joins it with what follows. This corruption
I believe to proceed from Marullus3 for his hymn to thesun contains a
passage evidently imitated from Lucretius: Cum primam tepidi aa

shew in other cases that Marullus corrupted Lucretius, where he has not
