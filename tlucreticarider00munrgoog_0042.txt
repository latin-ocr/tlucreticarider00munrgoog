Heinsius may have here been misled by Medius' negligence. It would
seem certainly that s and B are the same: if they are two, then their
agreement is very extraordinary‚ much closer than that between B and
the Gottorpian fragment.

Ι also possess a copy of Faber's Lucretius with a poor collation of A
'and B and the Gottorp. as well as many other notes and illustrations in
the writing of Isaac Vossius. Havercamp had a copy oi the same notes,
but has employed them with his usual carelessness. N otes l will show
what important use Ι have made ol them: they have enabled me to strip
him cf several ol the most showy feathers with which he had decked
, himself either from negligence or worse. Spengel, Christ, Goehel and
some others have in various journals and publications made much ado
about a codex Victorianus as they call it, once belonging to P. Victorius,
now in the Munich library, as if it were a rival, or nearly so, of A and
B. From the readings cited I see clearly that it is a common Italian
fifteenth century ms. neither better nor worse than twenty others, much
resembling the Verona and Venice editions and ol no importance what
ever. [As the reader has been already told, Ι examined this manuscript ἵ
myself at Munich during the summer of 1865 and can confidently affirm
that what Ι said oi it is the truth. It is much interpolated: its correc-
tions are not so valuable as those of Flor. 31 orI think of our Cambridge
manuscript. Ι have recorded some of its readings in my critical notes

j under the term ‘Mon.'‚ and have occasionally spoken of it as the codex

Victorii. Strauge that learned men should have taken so much trouble
about its own readings and said not a word ol the much more important
emendations of Marullus which it contains. This is not the case with
Prof. Sauppe in the program spoken ol above 3 butI cannot help citing
from its first page a few lines which Ι read with no slight surprise:
‘unum addo, quod ab aliis nondum quod sciam animadversum coniectu·
ramde victoriani codicis origine propositam valde confirmet. Post 1. 3
enim v. 360 versus novem scripti sunt, quos delendos esse homo quidam
doctissimus in margine monuit, qui versus 403-411 per errorem hic il-
latos esse vidisset. ratione autem subducta inter v. 360 et 403 versus bis
vicenos senos interpositos esse invenimus ut facile intelligamus in singu·
lis archetypi paginis versus vicenos senos scriptos inisse eiusque inter
scribendum cum unum vellet scriptorem victoriani duo folia vertisse. in
archetypo vero oblongi O. Lachmannus ostendit p. 3. 49. machabeis
eandem versuum rationem luisse'. Probably before this time the learned
writer will have discovered that his arithmeticis at fault and that he
has counted forty-two as fifty-two3 and that his theory is thus entirely
upset. But it is notior such a trifle as that, that Ι have quoted his
words. Does he really mean to essert that this Munich is not like every
other fifteenth century ms. a descendant oi the one brought into Italy by
Poggiol that the long lost archetype was preserved by some mysterium
