the other hand, that (laudidus took from stancius without ackuowledg-
ment much that Lachmann and others assign to Manrllus. Candidus,
as I have said above, formed his text on a copy of the first Aldine: in
doing this he must have had before him another edition with the ms.
notes of Marullus, perhaps the very one which he tells us was found on

, him at his death. If now all that is common to the first Aldine and the

J untine comes from Marullus, as Lachmann maintains, surely Candidus
must have been struck with this coincidence and would have recorded
it against Avanoius the editor of the great rival publisher. Yet Avan-
cius did borrow largely, very largely from Marullus, especially in the case .
of interpoleted verses made hythe latter. How is this to be explained? .
Evidently even before his death Marullus' labours on Lucretius were
known3 and probably there were more copies than one of these, the one
not always agreeing with the other. On this point compare notes 1 ιο

1 uel-627, where Oandidus makes some perverse transpositione of ’
verses, on the authority of Marullus he says in his note at the end ς but -

the learned annotator of one of the Laurentian mss„ states that some put
tel-564 after 576, and adds ‘verum Marullo parum referre videtur

quomodo legatur’. This annotator and Avancius Pius Candidus ,

Gifanius can hardly all have had the same copy: perhaps all were

different. Avanoius then may have had his notes in the very copy of ·

Ven. on which hc¹ formed his text3 and may have looked on themas

'publio property which he might make use of without acknowledgment ·'

according to the practice of the time3 for neither Pius nor'candidus
acknowledges' in his turn what he got from Avancius3 nor does
Naugerius the editor of Ald ‘l say a syllable of Candidus whose edition
he copied with few variations. ’

, But Lachmann to 111 98 cites' 1n proci of his charge that Avancius
was a dishonest plagiary three interpolated verses which doubtless were
composed by Marullus and are corruptly given 'in Ald. l. In notes
l to 111¹ 98 Ι have attempted to shew from Gifanius that Marullus
perhaps wrote putarit, and that Avancius intended to read the same:
Avancius was probably as good a Latin scholar as Marullus if less
¹versed in Lucretius. In the'line inserted after 1v·102 multoe for mullos
may be an error of the printer or an oversight of Avancius. In that
inserted after 1v532 there can be little doubt that he purposely wrote
auis, imagining thatrm's was a plural. The correcting of texts was then
in its infancy‚ and Avancius had so grievous a task before him in making
sense out of the monstrously corrupted Venice edition, that much must
in fairness be excused: we cannot tell what were the exact relations
between him ‘and Aldus and his printers At the end of his Catullus
published two years later hc has taken occasion to ‘give four peges
of Lucretian criticism‚ in which he has proposed many excellent altera-
tions of his former text, though I do not find that any editor before me
