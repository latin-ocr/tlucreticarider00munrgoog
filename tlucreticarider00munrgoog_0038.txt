of his example. When he is better known 10 England, the same result
will follow here. Though his Latin style is eminently clear lively and
appropriate, yet from his aim never to throw away wordS, as well as
from a mental peculiarity of his, that he only cared to 00 understood by
those whom he thought worthy to understand him, he is often obscure
and oracular on a first reading. Had his commentary 0000 twice the
length it is, it would have been easier to master. But when 0000 fully
apprehended his words are not soon forgotten. His love for merit of all
kinds incites in him a 0001 10 (10 justice to all the old scholars who have
done anything for his author 3 while his scorn and hatred 01 00001101
ignorance and ignoble sloth compel him to denounce those whom he eon-
victs of these offences. ln one instance, that of Forbiger, this sternuess
passes into ferocity: m'ost 01 010 0000001001 scholar could hardly avoid
in the circumstances in which he was placed.

industry, he has not been 00 happy 10 100 use of secondary evidence, that

of the Italian mss. and the older editions. Much he has taken on trust f

00 insufficient evidence, and much that he had before him he has not
always accurately used. Some proofs 01 1010 have been given, more will
00 seen below. But a still more serious defect must 00 told: he meant
his book 10 00 0 critical revision of the text, and left to others the task
01 explaining and illustrating the meaning. So far good: butas tha
text of an author in the condition of that 01 Lucretius cannot 00 always
rightly construeted without a sufficient knowledge 01 010 system and
its literature, he has not unfrequently strangely blundered and grossly
corrupted the poet's words: for examples 01Ι 1010 000 1 599-634 u 522

language as well as of the manner 01 Lucretius 10 particular enables him
often to amend his author with great success. As he wishes 100 10 pro

must himself have looked upon as only provisional Yet his greatest

Jacob Bernays in 1852 edited a text 01 Lucretius for the Teubner
series. There can 00 little doubt that carried away by the strength 01
010 admiration for Lachmann he has followed him too faithfully3 yet he
not unfrequently differs from him. Where he recells the old reading he
