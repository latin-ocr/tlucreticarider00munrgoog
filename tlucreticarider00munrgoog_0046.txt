TO NOTES I 29

and unless I err, 1 have shewn that not a few sections thus marked
by him are properly connected with what precedes and follows. Yet it
is certain that his theory applies to 11 lte-183, and more than one long
paragraph oi 1v v and vr. It has been shown sufficiently in the notes to
these passages that the most important of them have a close connexion
in matter and manner with each other. Like Lachmann, I have marked
them off by []. All through the poem many single verses and passages
oi some length are designedly repeated by the poet, some of them again
and again. Itis probable thathe would have removed many 01 them,
if he had lived to revise his work: the exordium 01 1v ior instance could
hardly have been leit.

Some readers may be surprised at the number of verses which have
been transposed in the poem 3 but they should remember that every
ψ ancient writing which depends finally on one ms. is in a similar plight.
When a scribe omitted by accidente verse, iri order not to spoil the look
of his book, he wrote it at once aiter the next verse, if he immediately
discovered his err0r3 if not, he omitted it altogether, or added it in
some other place, often at the bottom of a page, he would then affix an
a, b to mark the right order ; the next scribe would not notice or would
purposely omit these and so on: see Bentl to Hor. ars 46. Every one

of these errors has been committed again and again by the copyists ol ἵ

· our poem. Most oi these transpositions are certain and were made long
ago by Lambinus Marullus Avancius and others 3 many were first made
by Lachmann, Some of these I have not followed: not a few Ι have
first ventured-on myself. But connected with this question I must draw

⁷ attentiontoone point which seems ot importance. You would expectas ¹

a rule single verses 10 be thus transposed 3 and this is the case in Lucre
tius' mss. as in those oi other writers: sometimes too one or more verses
are repeated aiter the misplaced verse, which ought 10 follow itin its
proper place, as ir to shew the reader whither it ought to be transferred:
comp. 1v 991 ie. 999 oi the ,msa followed in them by 1000-1003,
which are only the vss. which follow it in its right place repeated aiter
it in its wrong place: see also v 570 (573) and what eomes aiter. But
besides such usual instances oi transposition there are throughout the

poem many small groups of verses, forming generally sentences complete ᾗ

in themselves, which have got quite out of their right place: comp, 1984
-987 (998-1001), 11 652-657 (655-659 680) and rv 1227 1228
(1225 1226), three passages first transposed by me, also 11 1139-1142,
iles-1170,111686-690‚1v50-52‚ v 174 175, 1127 1128. Now
that ascribe should so often transpose several consecutive verses always
forming an entire and independent sentence by mere casual carelessness,
is 10 me in the highest degree improbable. Again most of these passages
read to me like possible additions not necessary to the context, though
they improve it. I believe them then 10 be marginal additions by the
