poet, inserted on the same principle as the longer sections discussed
above: these too the first editor, faithfully preserving everything in his
copy, but not caring always to find the right place for what the author
left ambiguous, has inserted out of their order. Add 11 these v 437-
442 which the context could dispenso with: these vss. are found out of
place in Macrobius as in our mss. This increases the probability that
they were out 11 their proper order from the first, two apparently inde-
pendent authorities Macrobius and our archetype quoting them in the
same way. Perhaps these single vss. might be added to the list, 1v 202,
205, vl 957, 1225, 1237, 1270 as they might all be dispensed with.
Look too at 1v 129-142, so strangely disordered in thamsa: 133-135
may 11 111 marginal additions by the author afterwards wrongly placed ,
by the editor. The ms. arrangement of rv 299-348 has been already
accounted for. If 111 these passages are subtracted‚ there will then be
left a not very unusual number 11 single verses transposed by the ordi-
nar-y negligence 11 copyists The numbers occasionally given on the left
hand of the page denote of course the order of the lines in mss. which Lach7
mann follows in his edition: where spurious vsa of the mss. are omitted
from the text, he still allows them to count. For obvious reasons Ι
have followed him in this, as he will be the future standard of compari-
son, and there is great advantage in a uniform numbering of the verses.

Since many special questions of orthography are noticedlas they
occur in the notes, I should have thought it unnecessary to say more in
this place than that in essential points I follow Lachmann, if it were not
for the apparent unwillingnass of scholars in this country to accept even

' the smallest change in what they look uponasthe usual or conventional ·

rules of spelling. The notion of· any uniform conventional spelling is
quite a chimerasI never find two English editors following any uniform
system ; nay the same editor will often differ in different parts 11 the
same book. But whence comes this ‘ conventional' system, so far as it
does existi from the meritorious and considering their position most
successful endeavours 11 the italian scholare in the fifteenth century to
get rid of the frightful mass of barbarisms which the four or five pre-
ceding centurias had accumulated. They sought indeed 11 introduce

' rigorous uniformity in cases where variety was the rule 11 111 ancients3

and though these cases embraced only a few general heads, they yet
comprised a great multiplicity 11 particular instances, because involving
the terminatione of cases, the assimilation 11 prepositions in compound
verbs and the like. But where there was only one right course, they
generally chose it3 yet from the utter confusion into which the use 11 the
aspirata had fallen, their own language having entirely lost it in sound,
but at this time retained it in spelling; ι1111111111 almost complete iden-
