22 INTRODUCTION

he appears to have once had thoughts 01 doing, there is no doubt that
Lucretius would have owed him much The impulse given by Lachmann
10 the study 01 our poet has called forth numerous papers either inserted
in the German philological reviews or published by themselves, Some
are 01 more, some 01 less importance: my notes will shew where I have
been indebtod to them. One English publication 01 eminent merit, as
it criticises nottho text 01 the poem, but its matter and poetical
beauties‚ shall be mentioned elsewhere.

To return now to the manuscripts whose history was sketched above.
Though I examined the two at Leyden 101 some days so long ago as
1111 autumn 011849, what will now be said 01 them is borrowad from

“ Lachmann who had thern in his hands 101 six months and during that . »

time applied the whole force 01 his practised and penetrating intellect to
unravelling all their difficulties and obscurities Both, as already men-
tioned, belonged to the magnificent collection 01 Isaac Vossius. The
older and betterof the two is 01 the ninth century written in a clear and
beautiful hand: I call it A. It has boen corrected by two scribes at the .
time that the ms. was written, as. Lachmann tells us. 011101 1111111101
great importance: in most essentia] points he agrees minutely with 1111
ms. 01 Niccoli‚ the oldest 01 ¹the Italian mss.; and doubtless therefore
gives the reading 01 the archetype. It will be seen in notes 1 how 011111
Ι make the united testimony 01 A and Niccoli to outweigh all the rest.
Τ111 other Leyden ms. which I call B is 01 nearly equal importance: it
is 01 quarto size closely written in double columns, apparently in the
tenth century. It is probable that it and the ms. next to be mentioned
were copied 110111 some copy 01 the archetype, not likeA from the arche-
type 111111. Four portions 01 the poem are omitted in their place, but
corne together at the end in this order, 11757-806v928-9791734·
-785 11 253-304. Lachmann has demonstrated that these sections
formed each an entire leaf 01 the lost archetype: 16 29 39 115 arethe
numbers 01 these leaves. It is manifest then that after A was copied,
these leaves 01 the archetype had 1111111 out 01 their places and been put
together without order at the end, before B, or the original 01 Β, was
copied from it. More will be said on this point presently. B has had
several 0011111011,- but all 01 the 15111 century 3 one a very brilliant critic
101 his age, to whom are due many 01 the finest emendations in the poem,
as will be seen in notes l. This ms. was once in the great monastery 01
St Bertin near St Omer. Turnebus collated it in Paris and his colla-

. tion as we saw was used with much effect by Lambinus: it afterwards

came into the possession 01 Gerard John Vossius, Isaac's father. A
large fragment 01 another ma. closely resembling B in everything double
columns and all, except 11111 11 11 said 10 be 1 small folio, not quarto in
shape, is now at Oopenhagen: it contains book 1 and 11 down 10456,
omitting however the same sections as B, viz. 1 734-785 and 11 253-
