Beroaldi praeceptoris quondam mei: nunc collegae: impressus quidem:
sed tamen perpense examinatus. Codri quoque grammatici Bononiensis:
cuius copia mihi per Bartholomeum Blanchinum virum eloquii excultis-
simi facta est: Marullique poetae industria mira castigatum non defuit
exemplar Severo Monaeo Placentino graece latineque perdocto musarum
athleta non gravatim offerente’. He makes no mention at all 01 110 man
to whom he was most indebted, Avancius : for his text is a reprint 01 110
first Aldine, with however not a few changes 01 words or phrases, often
for the better, often for the worse, either inserted in the text or pro·
posed in the notes, and derived it may be presumed in many cases from
one or other 01 110 sources just mentioned. But strange to say when he
makes a change in the text, the lemma 01 his note,¹ nearly always con-
tains not this reading, but that 01 Avancius as if he had meant it to
, stand: thus 1 9 he rightly reads diffuso lamiae3 but his lemma has dlf-
' fuso numine with Avancius‚ which the latter however correots at the
⁷ end of his Catullus: and he adds ‘sunt qui legunt lamiae& 15 for
capta he wrongly inserts in the text ψᾶρας but his lemma has copta,
and his note rightly explains the construction and makes no mention 01
· quodque 34 his text properly has Reiicit, his lemma Reffica't after
Avancius ; 35 his text wrongly gives suspirans, the lemma aspiciam,
and so throughout the poem. This very singular circumstance Ι explain
‘in this way: he was living at Rome when his edition was printed and
seems 10 have sent the text and commentary separately; for the book·
seller prints at the end a long page 01 errore with this notice prefixed,
, ‘Hieronymus Platonicus Bononiensis bibliopola ad lectorem. contuli
Pii exemplar cum edito Lucretio: labeculasque pauculas notavi cet!
Pius’ edition was reprinted by Ascensius in 1514 with not a few
changes in the text, some 01 them taken from the notes. ·

y The next edition must be ever memorable in the history 01 Lucre·
tius, that published by Philip ,Giunta ‘anno salutis. mnxn. mense
martio’. Whether this means 1513 new style I cannot tell; but I
know that he dates a Gellius and a Romualdi vita as published in

· January 1513, ‘Leone pont. max. christianam ΚΡ. moderante’ and ’
‘Leonis X anno primo’. Now Leo X only became pope in March 01
1101 year3 so that here he must be speaking 01 1514; and in Florence

· at all events this mode 01 dating seems to have been in common use.
‘ The editor was Petrus Candidus who, great and important as the cor-
rections are which he has introduced, has yet used a copy of the first
Aldine upon which to make them, though he has never mentioned the
name 01 Avancius. It seems to have been 110 practice of those times
to take at least whatever was printed without acknowledgment: thus
Giunta regularly made booty of Aldus, Aldus of Giunta in turn.
What is said in the present case is grouncled on a close inspection 01

110 two volumes. Candidus, where he does not designedly leave hin
