same number 61 111166 in a page: curs had 26 lines in a page, excepting
only those which concluded a book. But renieiuber there was a heading
ortitle at the beginning of each section 5 and each 61 these headings oc-
cupied a line. Lachmann brings many 616616 61 this being the number.
When this 1116. was copied, it was clearly much torn and mutilated. It
was stated above that four portions, omitted in their place by B, come
together at the end, and that these each formed a leaf 61 the archetype

which had fallen out 61 116 proper place. Each 61 these alone 61 with its
headings consiste of 52 lines. Then turn to note 1 611 1v aee-347
(323-347 299-322) where this inversion is explained in the same way,

· by the accident that is of a loose leaf being turned the wrong way: 666

6166 note 1 1611068-1075 and 1094-1101, where the mutilation is
accounted 161 in the same manner. Thus we obtain six certainland·
marks in different parts of the poem. The archetype therefore consisted
of 300 pages, or admitting, as seems to be an undoubted fact, that a
whole leaf is lost between v1 839 aud 840, 61 302; 61 which the first was
not written upon, as well as one 16166116 reason or other somewhere
between 1 785, which ends one of the loose leaves at the end 61 Β, and
1068 which, as shewn in note l, begins a fresh leaf. Page 190 which

' followed the end of 1v was left blank. Imay also note that pp. 137 and

191 contained an index 61 the headings 61 1v aud v respectively, while
the headings 61 v1 616 crowded into the lower part 61 p. 249, the upper
part 61 which contained the last 13 111166 61 the text 61 v: see Lach. p.
398: ‘although the different titles come in their places in these books tce,
as well as in the first three which have no such index prefixed. Having
made for myself a list 61 these pages 61161 the rules stated in various

- places by Lachmann, Ihave found it 61 great use; as the ends 61 111166

throughout the poem towards the bottom 61 the several righthand pagos
had been specially exposed to niutilation in the daniaged archetype.
Verses also omitted in their proper places were apt in this 66 111 other
mss. to be put afterwards at the bottom 61 pages. Besides the injuries
which it had received from accident 61 111 usage, our archetype must
have been carelessly enough written, though A and B prove that it re-
tained many valucble vestiges 61 great antiquity, especially in the spell-
< ing 61 words, and though there may have been few stages between it
and the age 61 the author. There is one point, the nature 61 the hiatus
after ιν 126, 66 16 which it is not easy to accept Lachmann’s theory.
That there is a hiatus there, is indisputable and the special questions
connected with it are fully discussed in note lto that passage. As the
accidental 1666 61 6 whole 1661 would not suit his system 61 pages, he
boldly declares that twenty-five verses and one heading have perished,
thetis one single page 61 our archetype. Now it is easy enough, as we
have seen, to explain the accidental loss 61 6 leaf, by which every subse·
quent copy must necessarily want the contenta 61 that leaf: itis easy
