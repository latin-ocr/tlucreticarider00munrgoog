¹of my author Iowe much to the well-pondered remarks of Mt N. P.
Howard, whose letter to meI have printed in the first number of the
new Journal of Philology3 and, especially in the third and fourth
books, to the communicatione of my friend Professor J. E. B. Mayor,
to whose notes 1 have appended his initials

In the men and neth volumes of the Philologus thore is a long

‘J uhrcsbericht’ by Mr Fried. Polle on the Lucretius literature after

Lachmann and Bernays; and some remarks of his occur in Jahn’s

Lachmann’s errors there Mr Brieger, who is the more combative
ol tho two, indulges mainly in conjectural alterations of tho text.
Once or twice I have referred to Mr Holtze’s ‘Syntaxis Lucretianae
lincamenta’

On tho whole my criticism is now Ι believe more conservative than

Lachmann, I have followed him in changes which really corrupt the
