word, which must daily have been in everybody’s mouth, etymology in
remote times yielded as was natural 1ο sound: imperium again occurs
three, inperium six 116666, being doubtless in sornewhat less common use.
Now in Lucretius imperium impero or imperito occurs six times, and
the 6666 always spell with m, and so Lucretius spelt Ι have no doubt:
indeed many 61 116666 common words the silver age Ι believe more
frequently wrote with u, than did that 61 Cicero. Then Virgil uses iau
perium 40 times; and Ribbeck’s capital mss. have m in every instance,
except M which twice has inp, though one 61 116666 two cases is at least
doubtful: for Aen. v111 381 Fogginius prints imperiis. Yet in defiance
61 611 11616 evidence Wagner gives us inperium, surely without reason on
any view 61 1166 case; 166 1166 foundation on which we must build 16 11666
withdrawu from under our 1661. To take another common instance,
commuto occurs 9 times in the corpus inscrip. and always with ru 3 12 times
in Lucretius and always with ru. Other words are more uncertain: we
Ἴ 11661 16 1166 mss. impius aud inpius, immortalis and iuniortalia, cudrpcre
and colligere, complu and conpita, and so with other prepositions, ab, ob,
sub, ad: all tending to prove that usage was in most words uncertain.
Again we have 666616, 666 ecto, 6666166, 666116 aspiro expecto cet, s being
generally omitted ; and this agrees with Quintilian 1 7 4who implies
that it was a learned affectation 61 some to write exspecto in order 16 dis-
tinguish aa and 666616 from ear and pecta; it agrees too with all other
good evidence: the mss. 61 Virgil 16661616 precisely the same testimony
66 those 61 Lucretius, yet Wagner in all such cases writes aas: surely
we should ke'ep aa where the mse. keep it, aas where they have aas ε 666
so with supter or subter, sapidis or 66111116, ab· 66 ap, 611-66 op, aub- or
sup, succ- or susc, 6ηά 1166 like: appareo occurs 166 times in Lacr. 6ηά
16 always spelt thus by our mss: 66 apparo, appello (both l 6ηά 3 conj.) ;
but adpetitur and always adpone, adporto 66 atporto, in which words the
separate 16666 611166 proposition continued to 16616116 in exact conform-
ity with this the first volume 61 1166 corp. inscr. bas twenty times appareo
aud also apparitor, proving that in the earliest times the prepos. had
been assimilated in this common technical word: thus too in 1166 21 16-
stances 61 appareo in Virgil all Ribbeck’s mss. always bave app except
M once, Aen. x1 605, misled by the usage of its age: comp. the sugges
tive remark of Servius to Aen. 6616 ‘applicatz secundum praesentem
usum per dprima syllaba scribitur: seeundum antiquam orthographiam
...per p': yet in defiance 61 611 11616 Wagner makes Virgil always write
adpareo and the like. We find haud and haut, and sometimes aliut ali-
quit quicquit and the like, sound and etymology carrying on 66 undecided
battle in the mss 61 Lucretius, as in inscriptions and elsewhere: adque
is sometimes but rarely found, sound having here as might be expected
gained the victory: Wagner cannot be right in always forcing adquae 66
Virgil. Lucretius seems to have recognised only aad: he once has elatea,
