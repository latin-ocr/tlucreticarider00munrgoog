has given Inmbinus’ own words as those of Cicero. In his two bulky ¹
volumus there is not one week's genuine work beyond what scissors and
paste could do: seldom has performance fallen sofar short of profession
and opportunity.
There is nothing 10 11010111 us between Havercamp and Wakefield
who in 1796 and 1797 gave his three volumus to the world, rivalling
' the other’s in magnitude Yet the work, such as itis, is his own, and
is not a mere slothfnl compilation from others Gilbert Wakefield pos.
0000011 000 quality which a critic canili dispense with, that of despising
any amount of authority which did not rest on some real foundation,
and refusing to admit that, because 0 reading had appeared in edition
after edition for centuries, it might by that alone claim recognition. He
therefore set about a new revision which was to be based on manuscript
authority alone ; but, neither his knowledge nor his industry nor his
ability nor his teste suffioed for such a work. Hc professed to collate
five English mss, among them our Cambridge one, and most 01 1110 0111
editione This task he executed with incredible carelessness. As he had
the full use 01 the Cambridge ms, one might have expected that his
collation 01 11 would bc done with some 001ος but it is quite untrust
worthy. From this 00 well 00 1110 evidence 01 his own notes and the
nature 01 the 0000 Ι 10101 that his other collatioris are 001 more to .

still have been 01 little use, as he had no notion of the true relation

vpendent authority and thought he could not do wrong, 11 the words he
put in his text were found in one or other 01 them. Then he had to
take from Havercamp 1110 readings 01 the Leyden mss, and therefore
could gain no true insight into their character. As he had 00110011-

unmeaning verbiage. His work was got through with a strange precipi-
taney: when engaged on the first part, he had never read the other parts

Morbidly vain and utterly uncouscious of the immeasureable distance
between Lambinus aud himself, he assails the most brilliant and certain
emendations 01 the unrivalled scholar in a hideous jargon and with 0
vehemence 01 abuse that would be too great even for his own errors.
Thus by some fatality or other, by its falling into the hands 01 0 Gifauius

did display occasional flashes 01 native genius, and our notes will slrew
