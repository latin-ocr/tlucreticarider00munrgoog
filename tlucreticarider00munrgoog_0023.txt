follows Avancius in the minutest points of spelling and punctuation.
The latter for instance says in his preface that he writes ‘veteres
imitatus repertumst, itemst, necessest' and the like: Candidus in his
preface that ‘in tam culte, tam nitido, tam undecunque castigato poeta'
he will not admit arthaisms like volpem, volneru3 or autent, haudqua-
quumet and the like. And so in his text while rejecting Avancius'
patefactam, voloere, ete, he keeps his frugifereateia rapacem and a
thousand such forms which have no authority in their favour, while
those which he discards have much. Lachmann always so hard upon
Avancius says ‘huius ineptissimam scribendi rationem Eich'stadius

studiose imitatus est’, but has not a word of blame for (laudidus. ¹

But whence has the latter got his many and brilliant correctionsl
for few or none appear to come from himself. He says in his address
to Thomas Setherinus that what he did was to collate all the vetusta
exemplaria that were in Florence and to expungo what was condemned
by the obeli of Pontanus and Marullus, ‘praestantissimorum aetate
nostra vatum'. He refers of course to John Iovianus Pontanus and his
friend and pupil Michael Marullus, after Politian two of the first
scholare and Latin poets of the most flourishing period of Florentino
learning, the latter half of the fifteenth century: ‘Marullo edil Pontan' ’
bave the honour to be mentioned together by Ariosto in the Orlando
xxxvn 8. But Candidus goes on afterwards to ¹speak only. of Marullus
‘cuius in hoc opere censuram potissimum secuti sumus'; and in a note
at the end he says 'thatin changing the ordor of verses here and in most
other places he bas followed the arrangement of Marullus Το Marullus
therefore everything which is peculiar to the J untine has usually been
assigned, whether in the way of praise, or of blame as by Victorius
and by ¹Joseph Scaliger who inherited among many oth'er of his father’s
antipathies his dislike to Marullus. But Lachmann has gone much
farther than this, and has given to him not only by oversight‚ as will bc
seen in notes 1, much that belongs to older authorities; but everything
that first appeared in Avancius' edition as well, calling the latter ‘fur ’
improbus’ and other opprobrious names. That he got-much assistance
· from the labours cf Marullus is certain3 but by ascribing to the latter
everything that is in the J untine, in some respects more, in others less
creditis given ‘to him than he deserves. As I can throw some light on
this interesting question, I will examine it at some length here and in
various parts of notes l.

The scholar, poet and soldier, Michael Tarcbaniota Marullus Con-
stantinopolitanae, as he calls himself in the editions of his poems
printed during his life, appears from this title and his epitaph in San
Domenico of Ancona, where he and so many of his ancestors are buried,

us well as from the epithct Bizantius given to him by his friend Petrus
. Crinitus to have been born in Constantinople. As he can hardly
