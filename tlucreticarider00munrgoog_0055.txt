new edition Mon. denotes the codex cf Victorius in the Munich library.
Brix„ Ver. Ven. Ald. l Junt. Ald 2 are the editions fully described
above, where it is explained when and why the names Avancius, Candidus
Marullus, Naugerius are or are not used instead of that cf one cr other
of these editions. The ms. notes of Heinsius and Vossius, which are
often cited, indicate the notes by those scholars which are in my private
possession and have been described above. Lamb. Wak. lach. Bern.
Bcntl need* no explanation after what has been said; and in this
edition Pont. and Mar. designate Fontanus and Marullus, whose read-
ings I have got from the sources mentioned. The dots imply that
one verse, *chat more than one or an uncertain number are lost;
such interpolaticns as it has been deemed advisable to retain in
the text, are printed in small capitals ; the letters syllables and words
which are omitted in the mss. but can be restored with more or less

certainty, are given in Italics In quoting Ennius the last edition, ,

that of Vahlen, has been used ; for the fragments of the Reman scenic
writers, except Ennius, that of Ribbeck: in citing cicero the smaller
sections are referred to as far the most convenient for reference: for
Terence the several recent editions3 for Plautus Ritschl and Fleckeisen
in the plays they have publisbed 3 in the others the old variorum ed.
has been employed: in Pliny the sections of recent editions are cited, as
the older divisions are intolerably awkward. Notes l have been made
as short as is consistent with perspicuity: unless the contrary is
expressly stated or implied, the word or words which appear first in
the note are those of our text ; thus ‘genitabilis perticalis etc! signifies
that genitabilis is the right reading and is found in A and B and the
other chief authorities, but genitalia is mentioned for the reasons given.
Again ‘281 qaam Lech. torquem. pared J unt’ means that Lachmann
first gave the correct reading qiaam instead of quem which is the read-
ing of A and B and other mss as well as editions before the J untine
cf 1512 which prints quod, the reading generally followed by the old
editors. Of course if -any one before Lachmann had read paam, he,
not Lachmann, would have been cited for it. ‘Ed' means the present
editor. Let it always be remembered that the corrupt reading, cited
in a note, is 'that which appears in A and B, unless the contrary is
expressly stated.

The passages which were first added to the second edition have
been enclosed within [ ] in cases where ambiguity or awkwardness
might be occasioned, if no distinction were made between the old and
the new matter; but not otherwise.
