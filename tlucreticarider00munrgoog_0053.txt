dieunt irs singulari leae ovi et avi, atta· lece ove et ave, e're multitudinis lece
puppis restis et bae puppes restes: the fragment of Virgil just cited has
the nomin. plur. patris and messis, though we saw it had „messes in the
accus: in accordance then with these high authorities the mss. of Lucr.
not unfrequently retain this nomin. in -e's‚ which it would be monstrous
to extirpate: Ι have always therefore kept it. In precise conformity
with Lucr. Augustus has in the aecus. ageretis and labentes, fiais and
fines, conedae and once cormelis: once too the nomin. pluria On the
other hand he always uses the accus, gentes, departing in this word from
the rule of Varro and Lucr. We see from the corpus inser. that eia fa
-ea were all in use: it is probable that Lucr. occasionally employed the
termination -eis, intermediate in soundbetween es and -r's ; but, if so,
his manuscripts have left few or no traces, and it would be most perverse
to follow Avanoius Wakefield and others in thmsting it into his verses
in season and out cf season: v 1280 Β has nior-taleis, perhaps from
Luca: Augustus more than once has this eisin the abl. plur„ quadri
gaia, emeriter'a ; and the inscription in his honour still existing on the
arch of Rimini erected in raamidway therefore in time between his
res gestae and Luca, has celeberrimis, rr'ee‘a redditer'a A and B have
however not a few indicatione expressed or implied of the ending ei: see
note 2 to 111 97 ocula: these have of course been carefully preserved.
On another question, comprehending a multitude of particular in-
stances, I have followed Lachmann and our mss. which here too are on
the whole excellent guides: I speak of the vowel or consonant a followed
by another a. The old Latina appear to have been unable to pronounce y
uu; and therefore the ancient ο long kept its place after τις or ferque
or q was used: quom qum or eam, never qaam3 linqueret linqunt or lire-
euwt3 aequentur, aequetur or. secuntum equos (nom.) equa or ecua; uolgus
divos divom aevom and so on. They appear to have begun soonest to
tolerate aa in terminatione, when both were vowels, auae tuae and the
like. N ow the mss. of Lucretius have retained in very many instanoes
divom winus volgo vivont cet. ; equos (nom.) and ecus, ecura aeeam3 re·
linqueret relinquet or relincunt oftener than *relinquunt so aequentur
secuntur secatus locuntur locatam but with Lachmann Ι retain the uu,
when the mss. offer it, in order not to get lost cn a sea of conjectural
uncertainty like Wagner and some others, who not only desert mss. but
> in many cases intrude a spelling older than the age of ¹their author: thus
Augustus has rivus riuum annuum (not once ero or -vo); why not then
Virgil, or at least Varius and Tuccal The mss. of Lucretius are also
very pertinacious in retaining the genuine old forms reicit eicit or eiecit

, cet. and never offering reiicit eiieit and the like: Grai Graia, not Graii

Graiis. But further details on the most interesting points of the ancient
orthography will be found in various parts of my notes. Again in those
many cases where the sound was intermediate between u and i and the
