and made the best approximation he could to what his author might have
written, always taking the most ancient torm for which his authorities
supplied any testimony direct or indireet. Thus the question was not
foreclosed3 nor were we left to vagus generalities, but a firm historical
groundwork was gained upon which future improvements might be built,
if better evidence hereatter offered itself. Lachmann then in this, as in
so many other departments of philology, seems at once to have produced
conviction in the minds of the majority of the most thoughttul scholars, ,
in GermanyI mean ; for in our own country most seem to scout the
question as unworthy of serious attention: a great mistake; for Latin
orthography is a most interesting and valuable study to those who care
to examine it, and touches in a thousand points the history grammar and

pronunciation oi the language. Let me give two examples of the effect
at once produced by Lachmann. Otto Jahn in 1843 publishcd his

elaborate edition of Persius in which he adopted throughout the spelling
then in common use, though he had so many excellent mss. to guide him
to a better course: in 1851, the year altor Lachmann's work came out,
he publishcd the text ot his Juvenal and followed in it most minutely
the principles ol Lachmann ; and fortunately he had a most excellent
authority in the codex Pithoeanus; so that the spelling is probably not
very iar removed from the author’s own. In the years just preceding
Lachmann Halm publishcd several orations of Cicero with elaborate
critioel Latin notes: and yet, though his spelling was somewhat better
than that of J ahn’s Persius, itis still essentially ‘conventional’ and arbi-
trary: in the years following Lachmann he publishcd a series ot school
editions ol Cicero’s orations with brief German notes, and now in these
the spelling was wholly modelled on the system pursued by Lachmann.
The same system too he has carried out in those volumes of the elaborate
edition of Cicero edited by him and Baiter, which came out after Lach-
mann’s Lucretius. Stimulated by the examples ot Madvig Ritschl and
Lachmann the rising generation ot German scholars has pursued the
critical study of Latin with eminent success ; and nearly all of thern iol-
low in orthography the guidance of Lachmann 'l'his system then may
fairly Ι think be now regarded as the true ‘conventional' system; for
surely the Lachmanns and Ritschls of the niueteenth century have a
better right to dictate to us in the present day what shall be accepted as
‘conventional’ than the Poggios and Vallas of the fifteenth. Since my
first edition carne out, Madvig has publishcd the last books of his text ot
Livy, of which there exists but a single and very ancient ms : these he
bas edited in a form differing from that ot the other books, and has now
given his very weighty authority in favour of adhering to the spelling of
the oldest mss, with some reservatione which I do not understand And
now too in his new edition cf the de finibus he has entirely abandoned
the orthography of the other.
