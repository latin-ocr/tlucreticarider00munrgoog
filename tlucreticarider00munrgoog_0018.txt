LUORETIUS.

NOTES Ι

ON THE FORMATION OF THE TEXT

Ir Lucretius had come down to us with a text as uninjured as that of
Virgil and a iew other ancient writers, he could scarcely have been
rechoned among the most difficult Latin poets Certainly he would
have been more easy to explain than Virgil for instance or Horace 3 for
he tells what he has to tell simply and directly, and among his poetical
merits is not included that oi leaving his reader to guess which oi many
possible meanings was the one he intended to convey. Fortune however
ο has not dealt so kindly with him. Not that the great mass oi his poem
is not in a sound and satisfactory state: in this respect he is better off
than many others; but owing to the way in which it has been handed
down, his text has suffered in some porticus irreparable loss. It is now ,l
universally admitted that every existing copy oi the poem has come
from one original, which has itself long disappeared.
Oi existing manuscripts a fuller account will presently be given:
J let it suffice for the moment to say that the two which Lachmann has
mainly followed and which every future editor must follow, are now in
the library oi Leyden One is a folio written in the ninth century, the
other a quarto certainly not later than the tenth. Large fragments oi
one, if not of two others, oi the same age as the quarto and very closely
resembling it are also still preserved, partly in Oopenhagcn, partly in
Vienna. These manuscripts and at least one more must have lain ior
centuries in the monasteries of France or Germany‚ where they found at
different periods several correctors, more or less competent. It is to be
presumed then that they had some rendere, though few if any traces of
them are to be met with in the voluminous literature of the middle agee.
