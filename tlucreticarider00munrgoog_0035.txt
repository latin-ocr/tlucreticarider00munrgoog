edition in two large volumes. Though his reputation has never been
great, my readers will hardly perhaps be prepared for what I am going
to say. As Professor in layden he had the full use of the two Vossian
mss. there, the main foundation of a genuine text: how did he use this
advantage, which in profession he makes so much ofl The chief feature
of his edition is a vast and cumbrous apparatus of various readings,
derived 'from about thirtyone sources professedly distinct. Of these
thirtyone twenty-two are simply the various readings of the London,
edition just mentioned which Havereamp has taken and tumbled into
his own without changing the notation. Most of these are of the most
futile nature, taken from worthless editions which reprint or ignorantly
depart from those of Giunta, Aldus, Lambinus or Gifanius, ,such as that·
of Parcus, Gryphius', Fayus, Nardius and the French translator the
Baron de Ooutures: the more worthless the authority, the more fully it·
seems to be given There are also some collatioris of the mss. of Vossius
and that in the Bodleian which it did the London bookseller credit to
get together. 'Phe nine remaining authorities are these: a certain Basil
edition of 1531, its marginal readings, a collation of the Verona edition
011486, also jottings in its margin from three unknown mss, 0 second
collation of the Bodleian, and lastly the two all-important Leyden mss
The two last =are the only authorities hehas collated himself How has
he performed this taskl he has not noted one reading in three, the most
important variatione he usually omits, and the readings he gives are as
often wrong as right That which he has borrowed from others and
thrown in a lump into his edition is for the most part as worthless as
the scribblings of a schoolboy. So incredibly careless is he, that the
Vossian collatioris which he borrows from Tonson are or should be those
of his Leyden mss: see note 1 to v 471 for a glaring instance of a false
reading which he slavishly copies from Tonson and ascribes to his
Leyden quarto. Nay more the Bm of the London edition and his own
X are one and the same Bodleian ms. so that we have this ludi·
crous result, that the same ms. is cited twice¹ over as two independent
authorities. His various readings are therefore not only cumbrously
inane, but are a snare and delusion, and have led astray those who
like Wakefield have trusted to them. Thus in his hands the two un-
rivalled Leyden mss. have been worse than useless. What he does him·
self is always worse done than what he borrows from others, poor as
that generally is: he has collated none of the old editions except the
Verona, and that was done for him, and better done than he would have
done it for himself Nor are his explanatory notes much better : he has
heaped together in a crude mass those of the chief editors; but except in
the case of Virgil and Horace and one or two others of the best known
poete, indexes to which are in everybody's hands, he has not even sup-
plied the references to Lambinus' learned notes who from the circum-
