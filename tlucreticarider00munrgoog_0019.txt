2 INTRODUOTION

first halt 01 the twelfth century had taken the line 11011 the poem itselt 3
or had borrowed it 11011 Priscian inst. 1v 27 who cites it with nasci
instead 01 gigni, the editor 01 the bibliotheca having thought lit tacitly
to substitute gigni 11011 Lucretius. The latter is proved 10 00 the fact
by Mr Julius Jessen in the philologus vol. 30 pp. 236-238: he quotes
what follows 11011 Barthius' very learned note 01 Stat. silv. 11776:
‘nee vero cadentibus aut'collapsis iam rebus Romanis auctoritatem suam
amisit Lucretius noster, ut videre potes apud Magnentium Rhabanum
praefatione Laudum Daedalarum Crucis, Gulielmum H irsaugiensem in
Institutionibus Philosophicis 01 Astrologicis, Honorium Augustodunen·
sem in Historia Mundi, Ven. Bedam Libro de Metris’. Referring 10
the only printed edition 01 this work 01 William 01 Hirschau, who lived
11011 102610 1091, he shews that Honorius copied from him the passage
in question, and that William cites it thus: ‘Ex insensili credas sensile
nasci’, getting it clearly then from Priscian. Hrabanus Maurus and
Beda seem just as little 10 have known Lucretius at first hand. [Hermes
10181332, it is said that in Brit. Mus. ms. 377 (13th century) 01
Daniel do Merlai's Philosophia, in p. 90 a, Lucretius is quoted]

In Italy he was even more completely unknown A catalogue which
Muratori antiq. 111'p. 820 assigns to the tenth century, proves that the
famous library 01 Bobbio contained at that time librum Lucretii 13 but
before the fifteenth 10 Italian poet or writer shews any knowledge 01
him whatever. In the year 1414 the celebrated Poggio Bracciolini went

’ as apostolic secretary te the council 01 1101111100 and remained on this
, side the Alps in different countries, Switzerland Germany France and
England, until 1420, with 010 short interval passed in Milan and
Mantua During these years he procured from various monasterias
Ι many most important Latin werke hitherto totally unknown in Italy:
, see-Mehus’ pretace te his 1110 01 Ambrosius Traversarius p. xxxiii 1011.
Among these was a manuscript 01 Lucretius, obtained apparently from
some German monastery either by him or his companion Bartholomew
01 Montepulciano, about 1417 as his letters seem to indicate, and trans·
mitted the same year 10 his intimate friend the Florentino N icolb Nic
coli, a most zealous scholar and patron 01 the revived classical studies
This manuscript, which Poggio wrongly supposed to be onlya part 01 the
poem, has itself disappeared, but was the parent 01 every copy written
during the 15th century, that is to say 01 every 010 now extant with the
exception 01 those specified above: it must have very closely resembled
the Leyden tolio. ‘Et te, Lucreti, longo pest tempore tandem Civibus
et patriae reddit habere suae’ says Landinus in his poem in praise 01
Poggio. Niccoli having such 1 treasure in his hands was in no hurry to
part with it. We find Poggio writing to him in December 1429 10
remind him that he had kept his Lucretius twelve years. Α few days
later it is ‘you have had Lucretius now 101 fourteen years 3 Iwant to read
