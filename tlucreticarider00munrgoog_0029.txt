12 INTRODUCTION

Gifanius made use of, as has been already told. Victorius says of prande
in v 1192 ‘plaudo in Pont. libro': now since not only the Venice
edition, but the Verona and first Aldine have prande, and also the Bres-
, aian as I learn from Earl Spencer's librarian, Pontanus must have used
some printed edition now unknown. The pains which so eminent a

scholar as Victorius has taken in copying out twice the emendations of
Pantanus and once those of Marullus would prove the high estimation in
ἵ which those two learned men must have been held when he was a young
man of twenty. As he has also filled a copy of the J untine with long
parallel passages from the Greek, he must himself at one time have
contemplated an elaborate edition of the poet and has to be added to
the long list of scholare with whom this remained an unaccomplished
design. · ·
We have then an undoubted copy of what Pantanus himself asserted
to be his own original emendations ; and as they are accurately repeated
by Victorius in his second copy, if we subtract these we have in what
remains the undoubted corrections oi Marullus. Now the latter with
only a few variatione, easily to be accounted for as being earlier thoughts
or in other ways, all reappear among the alterations of the Munich ms.
which are however much more numerous. When we consider all this,
and remember that wherever Candidus in his notes mentions the name
of Marullus, the reading which he assigna to him is found here3 that he
tells us in his preface his text is grounded mainly on the revisions of
Pontanus' and Marullus, the latter more especially3 that, as the present
edition will demonstrate, the numerous readings which first appear in the
J untine, good bad and indifferent, where not taken from what we now
know to be those of Pantanus, nearly always agree with the corrections
of this manuscript, and finally that Candidus not unfrequently gives a
new reading peculiar to this of all manuscripts known to me, as in his
note to v 826 where he mentions parierwlo as a variation, we may fairly
conclude that Candidus in preparing his text had the use of this corrected
manuscript, and that the corrector was Marullus. It would be natural
too to conclude that this is his own copy amended by his own hand ; and
for the most part Ι do not doubt that this is so. However they cannot
all have been written at the same time, as the ink differs in different
plaees; and as so many of the emendations agree with those of Fontanus,
it seems not improbable that the ms was in his possession before it came
into the hands of Marullus. As the Italian handwritings of that age re
semble each other so much, at least to our eyes, the writing of the pupil
may not have differed much from that of the master. However that
may be, we must conclude that the corrections common to both belong
to Fontanus, as he was the elder and we saw above that he claims them
for his own, and the scholar would naturally borrow from the master.
The emendations too of Pontanus, valuable as many of them are, have
