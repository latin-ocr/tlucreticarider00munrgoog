fere quae in eo Lucretio recta sunt, mea sunt ; quae tamen iste aut si-
lentio praetermittit aut maligne laudat aut sibi impudenter arrogat'.
Yet so great was the skill with which all this was done that he deceived
many and was thought tc be a rival worthy of Lambinus. Contrary to
what many believe, the age loved brief notes 3 and his were brief, the
other's copious. Even the great critic of that generation J oseph Scali-
ger, who well knew the character of the man and accused him 01 gross
deceit towards himself, says ‘Gifanius estoit docte, son Lucrtce est trts-
bon’. Lambinus however knew the truth, and his wrath was as signal
as the provocation. In 1570 he brought out a third edition greatly im·
proved and enlarged ; much 01 1110 additional matter however consiste in
invectivas against the aggressor. In a long praiaco 01 great power and
beauty 01 style he states his wrongs. 'There and throughout his commen-¹
’ tary the whole Latin langnnga rich in that department, is ransacked 101
terms 01 scom and contumely. The same charges are repeated in 0 hun-
dred different shapes with curicus copiousness and variety 01 expression.
Gifanius with consistent cunning attempted no public reply to all this.
Many years afterwards, when Lambinus had long been dead, a new edi·
tion 01 the other's book was brought out at Layden in 1595, in which
many additions are made to the brief notes, bnt not a word is said 01 the
charges brought against him by Lambinus. He was rewarded 101 his
reticence, and fora century 01 111010 opinion was divided as to whether
he or Lambinus did more for Lucretius In private he corresponded
with the cankered and unhappy Muretus: the two exchanged futile
charges of dishonesty against the dead critic, who was far too genuine
a scholar 10 be capable of being a plagiary. Lachmann so stern with
Avancius has nothing to say 01 this much more flagitious case: ‘qui quo
iure' he observes ‘aut Lambinum aut alios compilasse dictus esset non
quaesivi'. Gifanius had 110 business whatever to 01111 0 poet: he was

Ι without poetical taste and grossly ignorant 01 matre.

Fora century after Lambinus nothing was done 101 Lucretius: the
common editions followed either Lambinus or Gifanius. In 1658 the
singular labours 01 Gassendi were given to the world. D'eeply versed in
the worlrs 01 the fathers and 1110 philosophy 01 011 ages down to tlre latest
discoveries 01 Descartes he devoted himself with the zeal of a disciple to
the dogmas 01 Epicurus. The two first 01 his huge folios are given tc
this philosophy, and a large portion of them to the exposition of Lucre
tius. Much that is curicus may be gathered from them, and I have
perused them with attention 3 butte say the truth I have not found
' much to my purpose in thern. The author was utterly devoid of the
critical faculty, and 011 that is 01 value in him on this head is borrowed
from Lambinus: as well as the most useful of his illustrations: his ccr-
rections of the text are almost without exception worthless In the 17111
century several distinguished scholars, Salmasius J. F. Gronovius Nic.
