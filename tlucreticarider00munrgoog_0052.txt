and t: lapsas for labsus is the same principle as rea (reos), rexi (recsi)
written sometimes recai, rectam from repo: to judge from the best mss.
labsus and the like became again much more common in the silver age.
Mommsen has recently published an admirable copy and exposition of
the res gestae of Augustus from the Ancyra monument Augustus was
somewhat oi a purist in spelling and cashiered an oflicer tor using in a
dispatoh the vulgarism isse (not iace) instead of ipse. His system quite
bears out what has just been said: he always writes imperium and impe-
rator, he has immortalis, but inmissas; impensa, while the heading of
the work, not written by him, but perhaps by Tiberius, has iapeaea:
generally malope and coalepiam, but once collepiam and collaticiae 3 esili-
am, but exstinquere3 on the other hand seasieas as well as sexiens, prov-
ing that a and as were identical: he writes appellaverant 3 but adqae
the only time he uses the word.

Another question involving a multitude of details is the use of ie or
es in the accus. plur. of participles and adjectives and substantivas
whose gen. plur. ends in iam, as well as of some other classes, doloris or
dolores, alcioris or araiores: here too Wagner involves himself in inex·
tricable perplexities by his eclectic system, when his mss were admirable
guidae, had he chosen to follow them. The mss, oi Lucretius are no less
admirable and probably represent very fairly the author's own usage :⁴
they offer -is five times out of six; and es is somewhat more common in
substantivas in very general use, as ipues vires aures. Inscriptions quite
bear out our mss, ς and the sole relic of Latin yet disinterred from Her-
culaneum contains this v. Utraque sollemnis iterum revocaverat orbes.
Perta recently printed in the Berlin transactione the few remaining
leaves of a ms. of Virgil, which he assigns to the age of Augustus and
which may really be of the second or third century: we there find the
acc. plur. of adjectives and participles ending 18 times in -is, 3 times in
es pares felices amantes ; ot substantivas we find sonoris, but 4times
uires, and artes messes crata classes aues, quite confirming the testimony
of our A and B. Varro de ling. Lat. vin 66 writes item qaod ia patrico
casa hoc penas dispariliter dicatvs civitatum parentum et civitatium pa-
rentium: ia mcusaadi llos montes fontes et lios montis fontis ; and in
Lucr. 11 587 we find potestates, v 1239 potestatis: then ib. 67 he says
qaid potest similias esse quara gens mens densl qaom loram cosas patri
aas et aecusativus ia multitudine siat clisparilis 3 aaut a primo fit gen-
tium et gentis, utrobique at sit i3 ab secando mentium et mentes, at ia
prebre solo sit i, ab tertio dentum et dentes at ia neutro sit i; well our
mss. six times have the acc. peritis, never peotes ; dentes four times,
never dentis ; mentes five times, once only, 11 otomatis. As for the
nomin. plur. ot such words, Varro l. l. 66 says siae reprehensione uulgo olii
